<h3 style="color: #000; text-align: left;">Thanks For Trying Out The GUI!</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin: 30px 40px 0;">Thank you for taking the time to try out the Phoronix Test Suite HTML5 GUI that was introduced as part of Phoronix Test Suite 5.0-Plavsk. This graphical user-interface is to complement the command-line interface (CLI) that remains our primary interface in using the Phoronix Test Suite. In earlier versions of the Phoronix Test Suite was a GTK2 GUI but this new HTML5 interface is designed to be more extensible and provide remote support for accessing the GUI while the software is running on servers / headless / remote systems.<br /><br />
With Phoronix Test Suite 5.2 the user-interface should offer more features currently accessible only via the command-line and other usability improvements. Your feedback is appreciated in polishing the interface for this open-source benchmarking platform. Additionally, patches are welcome and/or any enterprise custom engineering engagements or project sponsorship. Most of the Phoronix Test Suite client is currently developed single handedly plus patches from the community. The Phoronix Test Suite is <a href="http://www.github.com/phoronix-test-suite/">hosted on GitHub</a> and the code is under the GNU GPL.<br /><br />With Phoronix Test Suite 5.2 we also hope to introduce a new multi-system GUI for better managing multiple, local test systems from a remote server. This project will be similar to our existing enterprise-ready <a href="http://www.phoromatic.com/">Phoromatic</a> software for remote test farm management.<br /><br />
Thanks for using the Phoronix Test Suite and please help us by supplying feedback, etc.<br /><br />
Many Thanks,<br />
Michael Larabel<br />
